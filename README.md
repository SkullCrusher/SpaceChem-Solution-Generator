# SpaceChem-Solution-Generator
Creates solutions to the game SpaceChem with the use of the genetic algorithm.

## Current state
The program will simulate simple reactors for both red and blue but it won't do every instructions. The pieces are in place to add more instructions (bonding plates, input output places/triggers, etc) but they are not done.

## Warning
This is no longer under development because I found out there are many glitches inside spacechem that you can abuse to make your ractor much better. I did not want to have to try to simulate all of those.
